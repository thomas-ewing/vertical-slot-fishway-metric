# vertical-slot-fishway-metric

A methodology and python tools for the estimation of vertical slot fishway function.

## The need for fishway performance tools

Vertical slot fishways operate by dividing the water level difference across a large barrier into a number of small steps. Fish ascend the fishway by moving from pool to pool, with water level differences between the pools generated by a flow construction, normally a vertically oriented slot.

The performance of a vertical slot fishway is highly dependent on its hydrodynamic performance. The hydrodynamic performance of vertical slot fishways is highly predictable using relatively simple numerical models. While the hydrodynamic performance is predictable the ability of vertical slot fishways to pass a given fish species and size is less predictable, at least using simple tools.

This methodology and tools is intended to provide an estimate of fishway function (for fish) that can be coupled to hydrodynamic models, in-situ obervations, or used in the design process.
